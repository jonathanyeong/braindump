# High Performance Browser Networking

## Chapter 1

- 4 types of delays when we talk about latency.
  - Propogation delay - distance over speed.
  - Transimission delay - packets rate and data rate of link.
  - Processing delay - Process packets.
  - Queuing delay - Time waiting for process.
- We want our applications to respond within hundreds of milliseconds.
- Last mile latencies between ISPs are a big factor of speed. The last mile is when all the connections to your home is made, which results in a lot of cables and boxes -> i.e. lots of hops.
- Latency not bandwidth is the performance bottleneck for most websites.
